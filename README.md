# Oauth implementation with google indentity service and google drive api 

In this project I have used google Identity service for oauth2 implementation so that user can directly login to the system without explicitly typing user details.
and second of the project used the google api picker for accessing the google drive and uploading the files to it.

For this project React js I choose as a frontend .

For uploading the files to google drive I used access token as an Identity . Access token would expire after few minutes.

two external libarary used for this project 
a. react-google-drive-picker
b. jwt-decode
